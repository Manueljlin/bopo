Alt keyboard layout optimized for Pinyin inspired by Canary:
- Slight bias on right hand that's balanced by placing space and your own shortcuts and layers on the left thumb keys (just trust me bro)
- Emphasis on 1) low sfb and 2) a crazy amount of rolls in that order
- Right section has the vowel cluster. Vowels make up 60% of the last letters of the syllables (remaining 40% being `n` and `g`) but only 2% of the initial ones. That means that more often than not, you'll start typing a syllable on the left half and finish on the right like a Steno russian roulette.
- Unlike Canary, there's more pinky usage, but it's for letters that are overwhelmingly used either zero times or once within the same syllable. Most common combined consonant pairs are `ng` (~55%), `sh` (~15%), `zh` (~15%) and `ch` (~14%) covering pretty much all of that.

> [!NOTE]
> If a significant part of what you write is English, especially if you are a programmer, I'd advice you _not_ to use this, or at least swap between this and `(Colemak-DH | Canary | Nerps | Sturdy | ...)`. It's not quite QWERTY meme tier, but much closer to that than even Dvorak.

> Imagine for a second typing `defmacro`, `match`, `type`, `const`, `import`, `ref`, `function`, `struct`... Ouch.

0.031% sfb and ~65% total rolls seems promising
